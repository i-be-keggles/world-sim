# World Simulation
This is the backend world simulation for [The Bird Roads](https://github.com/i-be-keggles/the-bird-roads). It handles the overall economy, faction power, and world state via simulating npc movement and actions in real-time.

It is written in Python to be integrated with Unreal Engine. Potential rewrite in C++ at a later date.


## Running the sim
To run the simulation locally, execute [driver.py](driver.py).
Note, if your screen resolution is under 1440p, you may encounter issues with the map scale.
